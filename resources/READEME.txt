TL:DR
Updated to brief MVC requirments

What I have done in short > Moved almost all files with HTML to view as that's where HTML files go
Created Controllers relevant to what we need will be assigned accordingly
Create Routes to these to displaying them on page


What I did:

Create Views which means I have removed almost all files from the public folder that have HTML and moved them to Views.

Why? Views is where the HTML files are stored

Why is there a ".blade.php"? This is due to Laravel having blade there is no difference but to keep with laravels file naming in the view folder we will be keeping .blade.php


Controllers?
I have made multiple controllers that will now need the relevant code in to allow for access to pages

What they all do:

HomeController:
Purpose: Manages the home or main dashboard of the application.

Typical Actions: Display the home page, handle general application overview.

AuthController:
Purpose: Manages authentication-related actions.

Typical Actions: Handle user login, registration, logout, and password reset.

DashboardController:
Purpose: Manages the user dashboard.

Typical Actions: Display user-specific information, summaries, and metrics.

InventoryController:
Purpose: Manages inventory-related actions.

Typical Actions: Display inventory lists, add new inventory items, update existing items, delete items.

InvoiceController:
Purpose: Manages actions related to creating and handling invoices.

Typical Actions: Create new invoices, display invoice details, list all invoices.

CategoryController:
Purpose: Manages inventory categories.

Typical Actions: Add new categories, update existing categories, delete categories, list categories.

AdminController:
Purpose: Manages administrative actions for system administrators.

Typical Actions: Handle administrative tasks like user management, system settings, and monitoring.



What about routes?

web.php

When you go to the root URL (/), it shows the home page.

Going to /login shows the login page.

/register takes you to the registration page.

/dashboard displays the user dashboard.

/inventory shows the inventory list.

/create-invoice opens the invoice creation page.

/categories shows the inventory categories.

/sysadmin takes you to the system administration page.

/invoice-form displays the invoice form.
